## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Headers & Quotes

In Markdown, create headers using a hierachy, from H1, represented by `#` to H6, represented by `######`.

# This is an <h1> tag
### This is an <h3> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

In a Markdown document, you can include quotes using the `>` before the line. For example:
> Something someone said
> -- Their Name


### Text

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ with Markdown. You can even [link to a website!](https://ucla-data-archive.github.io/2020-04-10-ucla/)

**This will be bold**
_This will be italic_
*This will also be italic*

_You **can** combine them_


### Lists

* Using 
* bullet points
  * Like
  * these
  
You can also create ordered lists:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three
  1. 3a
  1. 3b
