## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

**To create an R Markdown document in RStudio, select `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown`.


### Headers & Quotes

In Markdown, create headers using a hierachy, from H1, represented by `#` to H6, represented by `######`.

# This is an <h1> tag
### This is an <h3> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

In a Markdown document, you can include quotes using the `>` before the line. For example:
> 
> -- Their Name


### Text

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ with Markdown. You can even [link to a website!](https://ucla-data-archive.github.io/2020-04-10-ucla/)

**This will be bold**
_This will be italic_
*This will also be italic*

_You **can** combine them_


### Lists
You can create unordered lists:

* Using 
* bullet points
  * Like
  * these
  
You can also create ordered lists:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three
  1. 3a
  1. 3b
  
## Exporting Rmarkdown

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

In order to export in RStudio, select the **Knit** button in the upper-left corner; in the drop-down, select a format and location to save the file. R Markdown files can be exported to a wide range of document types, including HTML, PDF, and MS Word. 

Now you have the tools to create and produce a report including your text, data, code, figures, and more! We'll cover creating reports in more detail in our next workshop on May 1, 2020.


Until then, enjoy exploring and creating with Markdown!
