# Objectives

# Today: 

- Understand the value of writing reproducible reports
- Recognize and compile the basic components of an R Markdown file
- Write and use markdown in 
- Write R code chunks, and understand their purpose, structure and
  options
- Knit a document that contains markdown and R code into html
- Be aware of output formats an R Markdown file can be exported
- Publish the output of your knitted R Markdown document to Netlify

# Data analytic papers/reports

* Data analysts write a lot of reports, describing their
analyses and results.
* Writing reports in Word or [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) can incoporate analysis and ouput graphs together in one doc.
* But tweaking the report and parameters can be difficult:
  * have to fix or change code, run it, get output and copy over to document
  * will have to do this multiple times as you tweak, gets confusing, prone to error
* Having the code, analysis and output in one document that is **runable** helps with this
* Makes changing formatting or analysis much easier to maintain
* Also, easier to re-run with changes (no copying and pasting to word or other typesetting systems)

???

* Beginners often write R scripts & email those scripts & graphs around.
* This can be problematic and cumbersome

# Literate programming

* Ideally analytical reports are _reproducible_ documents 
  * If an error is discovered, or if some additional observations are added to the
data, you can re-compile the report and get the new or corrected
results. 
* Key R package is [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/). 
   * It lets you to create a document that is a mixture of text and chunks of
code. 
* When the document is processed by `knitr`, chunks of code will
be executed, and graphs or other results inserted into the final document.
* This sort of idea has been called **literate programming**.
* `knitr` lets you to mix basically any sort of text with code from different programming languages 
* We'll use `R Markdown` that primarily mixes Markdown
with R - though you can use Python, SQL or other languages in R Markdown.
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a light-weight mark-up language for creating web pages (the name is a play on the word [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) where you annotate a document with info to display text, e.g. html tags)
