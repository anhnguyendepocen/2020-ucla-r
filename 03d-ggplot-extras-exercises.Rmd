### Exercise 


```{r load-gap, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(ggrepel)
```

Think about what it would to alter the code to pick the maximimum, minimum, medium for lifeexp & gdp instead of random 10 countries. Here's how you would get the max gdpPercap and lifeExp for gapminder. In the second step we took converted our factor variable country to 

```{r}
gap_min_max_med <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap) | lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>% 
  gapminder$country %>% 
  levels() 
gap_min_max_med
```

```{r}
as.character(gap_min_max_med$country)
```
